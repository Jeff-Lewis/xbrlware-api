By accessing and using the xbrlware API, you agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions.

1. API License. Subject to the limitations and conditions described herein, you may use the xbrlware API to create an application (your "Application") to access data, content, information and other materials ("Content") stored in the xbrlware.com website (application) for the non-commercial opensource purpose.

You must make the most current Content available on your Application and remove any Content that has been removed by xbrlware.com or the end user that provided the Content.
